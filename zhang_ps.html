<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>
I am a student of Woods College of Advancing Studies at Boston College and I do not have any knowledge about IT. I was considering to take IT class during my high school year because I am interested in the programming but instead of that I took business.

<h2>My Interest In Web Development</h2>
<p>
I am planning to make a website just for interest during my senior year during high school and I looked up a lot of informations about the web programming. Even though I am fail to make my own website and I do not have chance to study web programming. So I would like to study web development during this class.
</p>

I used to play the piano and violin since my kindergarten. But I began to play the cello since my sophomore year during high school. So I am the girl who really like all kinds of instruments. I love traveling and my dream is to travel around world. 
</p>

<h2>What I Hope to Gain from this Course</h2>
<p>
I want to study some knowledge and skills for web-site development. After I have some skills in web development, I want to make an easy website by myself. And also I want to know how internet works and web works when they just came out. 
</p>

<h2>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About</h2>
